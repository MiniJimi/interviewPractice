#e.g.  TwoSum

#Description: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add #up to target
#Assumptions: each input would have exactly 1 solution

#We are indexing through the array of integers until we find a pair of numbers that equal the sum of the target.
#We use i as value1, and j as value2, where the goal is value1 + value2 = target
#We can use two for loops for i and j to index positions through the array.
#Return position of i and j that are equal to the target

#Soln
